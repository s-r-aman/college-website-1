       <p>THE PRODUCT <strong>“SMART LIGHTS”</strong> IS A LOGICAL SOLUTION OF CONTROLLING TRAFFIC ON BUSY INTERSECTIONS AUTOMATICALLY ON THE BASIS OF TRAFFIC DENSITY ON A PARTICULAR STRETCH OF ROAD. CURRENTLY THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS WORK AT A PRESET TIME AT WHICH EACH SIGNAL IS TURNED GREEN TO LET THE TRAFFIC GO BY AND RED TO STOP THE TRAFFIC FLOW.</p>

    <p>THE INHERENT FLAW WITH THIS WORK PRINCIPLE IS THAT IT DOESN’T CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC ON A GIVEN STRETCH OF ROAD LEADING TO TRAFFIC JAMS AND WASTAGE OF FUEL AND ESSENTIAL MANHOURS WHICH CAN BE OTHERWISE UTILIZED IN PRODUCTIVE WORK.</p>
    <p>THE SYSTEM WORKS ON THE BASE OF COUNTING AND ANALYZING THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC FLOWING THROUGH A SECTION OF ROAD BY MEANS OF LOAD CELL SENSOR CONNECTED TO RASPBERRY PI MICRO-COMPUTER CONTAINING THE NECESSARY LOGIC REQUIRED. THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS ARE THEN OPERATED ON THE BASIS OF THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES THUS ENSURING IN HASSLE FREE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT.</p>
    <p>IT IS A RASPBERRY PI BASED DEVICE DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR USE IN AUTOMATION OF A CITIES TRAFFIC CONTROL AT BUSY INTERSECTIONS. THIS DEVICE IS BASED ON THE LOGIC OF DETECTING FLOW AND DENSITY OF TRAFFIC PASSING THROUGH A STRETCH OF ROAD. THE HARDWARE USED IN THIS PROJECT IS MINIMAL SO AS TO ALLOW ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS INDEPENDENT DEVICE TO CONTROL THE DEVICE.</p>
    <p>THE SYSTEM WORKS ON THE LOGIC OF COUNTING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES PASSING THROUGH 4 DIFFERENT ROADS MEETING AT AN INTERSECTION AND COMPARING THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC AT EACH OF THE ROAD. THE COUNT IS DONE BY THE USE OF A LOAD CELL SENSOR EMBEDDED IN THE ROAD SURFACE PROVIDING THE INPUT TO THE MICROCOMPUTER RASPBERRY PI WHICH DECIDES ON THE BASIS OF THE INPUT RECEIVED FROM OTHER SENSORS. SHORT-TERM CONGESTION CAUSED DUE TO TRAFFIC INCIDENTS OR OTHER ROAD ENVIRONMENT FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES TRAFFIC FLOW CAPACITY OF A LINK WHICH FORMS A MAJOR PART OF TRAVEL TIME DELAYS.</p>
    <p>ACCURATE AND RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF REAL-TIME TRAFFIC STATE IS ESSENTIAL FOR OPTIMIZING NETWORK PERFORMANCE DURING UNPREDICTABLE EVENTS. INACCURATE ESTIMATE OF CURRENT TRAFFIC STATE PRODUCES UNRELIABLE TRAVEL-TIME ESTIMATIONS WHICH LEAD TO INEFFECTIVE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES DURING TRAFFIC INCIDENT. </p>
